## 🧽 Task 02 – Titanic Dataset EDA & Cleaning (in Excel)

I performed full EDA and cleaned the Titanic dataset using Excel.

### ✅ Steps Taken:
- Removed unnecessary columns: `Cabin`, `Ticket`, `Name`
- Handled missing values in `Age` (with median) and `Embarked` (with mode)
- Analyzed distribution of `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Survived` via Excel tables and filters
- Created a cleaned version ready for modeling

### 📁 File:
- `Task_2.xlsx` – contains both the raw and cleaned sheets

> Entirely done in Excel — no Python required 🎉
